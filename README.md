## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I am very passionate about the projects I choose and  feel that helps me to already have a head start on what i want it to look like and what functionality i would like to incorparate. 

### Weaknesses:

I struggled this unit with understanding alot of concepts such as CRUD, class components and life Cycle Methods which are key components to creating a react act. I am hoping to gain more of an understanding as I create my own react app.  


### Opportunities: 

This is an opportunity to show what I have learned this unit and to fill in missing gaps of information. This is something that i started building in the past and that myself and many others can benefit from using. This gives me the opportunity to bring my idea to life. 

### Threats:

I have this exact picture in my mind and when i cannot accomplish exactly that i tend to feel defeated. I do not like compromise with my ideas.
